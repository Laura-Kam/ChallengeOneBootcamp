## Code Style

* Standard HTML and CSS
* Language English (USA)

## Actions taken

* I refactored html by ensuring the heading elements followed a sequential order, by changing the footer heading from h3 to h4.

* Adding semantic elements to divs for readability. These were header, footer, nav, aside and section. I commented on changes made in the html file.

* I added 'div id' to 'search engine optimisation' link to make sure internal link functioned in html.

* I added 'alt' elements, and commented them in HTML, to all images for accessibility purposes.

* I provided a precise descriptive title for accessibility 'Horiseon-search-engine-optimisation'.

* In css, I grouped the 'benefit' classes in the <aside> into a single block as they had the same properties for improved readability.

## Build status

* Website is fully functioning.

## Challenges faced:

* A bug I faced was with grouping classes together with the same properties. This was overcome by using commas in between class names e.g .Screenshot: https://github.com/Laura-Kam/ChallengeOneBootcamp/issues/5#issue-1292321885

* Another bug I had was that the 'aside' container text turned black instead of white. This was fixed on html as I had forgotten to change the closing tag for the previously named 'div' to 'aside'.
